# Movie Recommendation System

Movie Recommendation System

Project Overview

A Movie Recommendation System is an application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, past interactions, or similarity with other users. This system can be built using various techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

Project Objectives

Develop a recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions.

Improve user experience by filtering relevant content.

Implement different recommendation techniques and compare their performance.


Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for deep learning-based models), Flask/Django (for deployment)

Database: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn


Dataset

IMDb, TMDb, or MovieLens dataset (contains user ratings, movie metadata, and interactions)


Approach & Methodology

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Load the dataset and clean missing or inconsistent data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.



2. Building Recommendation Models

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on features like genre, actors, or director.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user preferences and similarities with other users.

Hybrid Model: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.

Deep Learning Model (Optional): Uses neural networks for personalized recommendations.



3. Evaluation & Performance Metrics

Use metrics like RMSE, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure accuracy.

Conduct A/B testing to compare different models.



4. Deployment

Develop a web interface using Flask or Django.

Deploy the model using cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.




Expected Outcome

A functional movie recommendation system that personalizes suggestions for users.

Insights into user preferences and trends based on data analysis.

Comparison of different recommendation techniques with performance reports.
